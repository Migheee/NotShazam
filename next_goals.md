# Performance Optimization Plan for Audio Fingerprinting Script

## 1. Improving the Fingerprinting Algorithm

### 1.1 Exploring and Understanding Better Peak Finding Algorithm
- **Objective**: Enhance the current peak detection algorithm to improve its accuracy and efficiency.
- **Action Steps**:
  - Review and experiment with alternative peak detection methods like `scipy.signal.find_peaks`.
  - Study **local maxima algorithms** and identify improvements to the current method.

### 1.2 Investigating Faster Data Structures
- **Objective**: Optimize the data structures used for handling peaks and spectrograms to improve performance.
- **Action Steps**:
  - Explore efficient data structures like **heaps**, **KD-Trees**, or **hashing** for faster access to peaks.
  - Study `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` or similar structures for spatial data indexing.

### 1.3 Switching to a High-Performance Compiler (Numba)
- **Objective**: Utilize a JIT compiler like **Numba** to speed up critical code sections.
- **Action Steps**:
  - Integrate **Numba** to accelerate numerical functions.
  - Focus on performance bottlenecks and apply `@jit` decorators to those functions.
  - Refer to Numba's official documentation: https://numba.pydata.org/

## 2. Enhancing Performance

### 2.1 Introduction of a Pool of Threads
- **Objective**: Parallelize the code to improve runtime by distributing tasks across multiple threads.
- **Action Steps**:
  - Use **`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`** for parallelism.
  - Explore **multiprocessing** for CPU-bound tasks.
  - Read about concurrent programming: https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/

### 2.2 Memory Management
- **Objective**: Optimize memory usage to prevent memory leaks and reduce overhead.
- **Action Steps**:
  - Study **garbage collection** in Python using `gc` and **memory profiling** with the `memory_profiler` module.
  - Avoid unnecessary data copies by leveraging **numpy** and using memory-efficient techniques.

### 2.3 Adopting a Faster Hashing Algorithm
- **Objective**: Use a faster hashing algorithm to improve the speed of generating fingerprints.
- **Action Steps**:
  - Explore **`xxhash`** or **`cityhash`** as alternatives to `sha1` or `md5` for faster hashing.
  - Compare the performance of different hashing libraries to determine the best fit.
